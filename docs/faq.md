# FAQ

### What is SuperGrep?

Retrieval + inference offload for AI coding agents: four tools over an index
kept in two places. `find` and plain `sql` run on your machine, over a keyword index that
lives in plain files inside your repo. Anything with meaning in it - `search`,
a `sql` statement with a ranked search inside it, and `ask` - runs in the
Infino cloud over the same index's platform copy, where every embedding is
computed, so the heavy compute stays off your laptop. `ask` hands the
question to small models on the Infino service, which work the index at
once and return the rows they found. Either way the point is the same: an
agent answers questions about
the codebase, or delegates its exploration, without reading it file by file.
The package, the CLI (`cx`) and the MCP server are still named
`code-context`.

### When should an agent use it instead of grep?

The rule of thumb: the more a question spans the repo, the more the index
saves. Use it for understanding how a subsystem works, finding code by
meaning when you do not know the identifier, and ranking or aggregating
across the whole repo. For the grep case itself - every occurrence of a known
symbol or literal string - `find` answers from the same index: every matching
line, cited `path:line`, complete and unranked, with no file scanned.

### Does my code leave the machine?

Not unless you ask it to. With a local-only install there are no accounts, no
API keys and no server: `find` and plain `sql` run offline over the keyword
index. The opt-in is an account (`install --platform`, or `--db`, next
question), which also keeps the index in a database you own on the Infino
platform; that is where embeddings are computed and where `search`, semantic
`sql` and `ask` run.

### Can the index also live on the Infino platform?

Yes, and it is the same index. `cx index --db https://host/<database>
--api-key-file <path>` builds the local index exactly as without the flag and
then loads the same chunks into that database; every sync after it (the
explicit `cx index`, or the MCP server's auto-sync as queries arrive) applies
the same diff to both, so the two never drift. `find`, `search` and `sql`
keep reading the local index. `cx mcp --db ...` adds one tool that runs on the
platform copy: `ask`, which hands a question or task to the platform's
retrieval agent and returns the rows it retrieved - exact `path:line` places
with the code, plus counts and rankings - for the coding agent to compose
from, never a written summary. By default the platform embeds its copy with
its own model. Every
platform setting is a command-line flag on `cx index` and `cx mcp` (`--db`,
`--api-key-file`, `--embed-provider`, `--analyzer`, the timeouts, the tool
caps); the key comes from a file or from `INFINO_API_KEY`, never from the
command line. [The reference's flag table](reference.md#platform-flags) has
every one.

### How fast is it usable after indexing starts?

Keyword (BM25) search is live within seconds on a typical repo, before the
embedding model even finishes downloading. Vectors backfill in the
background and semantic and hybrid ranking unlock automatically when they
land. If the vector stage fails, keyword search stays live and the index
reports that honestly rather than failing.

### Do I have to index before I can search?

No. The first `find`, `search`, or `sql` on a repo that has never been indexed
builds the index inline and answers on that same call - keyword search is live in
seconds, vectors backfill behind it. Run `cx index` first if you'd rather
kick the build off explicitly, or set `CX_AUTO_INDEX=0` to make an unindexed
query return a "index it first" error instead of building. With `--db` the
same first-query build also loads the platform copy, once the local stages
are done.

### Can one server handle more than one repo?

For `find`, `search` and `sql`, yes: each takes an optional `path` (an
absolute repo root); omit it to use the server's startup root, or pass it to
target a specific repo when a session spans several, each with its own index
in its own `.infino/`. `ask` is scoped to the one platform
database the server was started with, since that database holds one
repository's index; it refuses a `path` naming a different one.

### Where does the index live, and can I share it?

In `.infino/` in your repo root, as plain files (added to your `.gitignore`
automatically the first time you index). You can copy it, cache it in CI, or
put it on object storage. It is a live index the engine queries in place, not
a snapshot you export.

### Does it stay fresh as I edit?

Yes. Sync is incremental: a per-file state map (size/mtime prefilter, then
content hash) re-chunks and re-embeds only the files that changed, so a
one-file edit syncs in a fraction of a second and an unchanged tree is a fast
no-op. The MCP server also auto-syncs in the background as queries arrive.

### What happens on a repo too big to index fully?

Indexing caps how many files it takes (`CX_MAX_FILES`, default 500,000); files
past the cap are left out. The cap is not there to bound memory - chunks and
vectors stream to disk, so nothing holds the tree at once - it is there so an
`index` aimed at the wrong directory stops instead of reading everything it can
reach. Half a million files is past any repository and past a laptop's own code
and logs, so a corpus you meant to index goes in whole.

When a tree does reach the cap, the index is marked partial and nothing about
it is quiet: `cx index` prints a warning on that build and on every sync after
it, naming the files skipped and the exact `--max-files` value that would
cover the whole tree. `cx status` reports it, and every `find`, `search` and
`sql` result carries a `partial` note with the files skipped and the cap in
effect, so an agent treats a missing match as "maybe not indexed" rather than
"not in the repo." Raise `CX_MAX_FILES` (CLI: `--max-files`) and re-index for
full coverage.

### What tools does the MCP server expose?

Four, one per question: `find` (every line containing an exact string, cited
`path:line` like `grep -n`; complete and unranked, the grep replacement),
`search` (hybrid keyword + semantic retrieval, one ranked pass, hits carry
chunk content with `path:line` ranges), `sql` (read-only `SELECT`/`WITH`
over the index, with the ranked search functions usable as table-valued
relations so search composes with `GROUP BY`) and `ask` (a question that
spans the repository, answered as the rows the service retrieved rather than
as prose). `find` and plain `sql` run on your machine with no account;
`search`, a `sql` with a ranked search in it, and `ask` run in the cloud over
the same index's platform copy.

Every near-duplicate retrieval tool worsens an agent's tool selection, so
each of the four earns its place by answering a question none of the others
does: `find` and `search` are not duplicates, one is complete and unranked,
the other ranked and top-k; `ask` is not a fourth flavour of either, it
hands the whole question to a loop that queries the index itself. There used
to be a fifth, `explore`, which ran a long multi-turn loop on one question
and returned a written answer; measured, several asks issued together were
faster and cheaper, so it is gone. Among
the local three there used to be another, `reindex`; measured, no Sonnet run
ever called it, Haiku called it where it hurt, and every tool in the list is
prompt text on every turn. The first query builds the index, every query re-syncs it, and
`cx index --full` rebuilds from a shell.

### How is SQL over code useful?

The engine's search functions are SQL table functions, so one query can rank
and aggregate at once. "Which files have the most code about X" becomes a
single `SELECT ... FROM bm25_search(...) GROUP BY path ORDER BY ...`, instead
of a grep-read-tally loop that reads source into the context window.

### Which languages are supported?

Chunking cuts at definition boundaries with tree-sitter for TypeScript/JS,
Python, Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, Ruby, C#, and PHP; Markdown splits at
headings; everything else falls back to fixed-window chunking, so any file is
indexable.

### Which MCP clients work?

Any MCP client, over stdio. In Claude Code (recommended form, since `alwaysLoad`
keeps the tools in view when many MCP servers are configured):
`claude mcp add-json code-context -s user '{"command":"npx","args":["-y","@infino-ai/code-context","mcp"],"alwaysLoad":true}'`
(or install the plugin; see the README). Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Cline,
and others use the standard stdio config in the README.

### What is it built on?

The [infino](https://github.com/infino-ai/infino) engine, which runs SQL,
full-text (BM25), and vector search over one copy of the data in-process. The
same engine and index format also serve logs, docs, and agent memory.
