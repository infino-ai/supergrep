# Tradeoffs

SuperGrep is a ranked retrieval layer, not a do-everything code tool. 

### Where a model reading the files does better

A judge - Opus 5.5 with the repository checked out - checks every claim in
the same thirty-six questions answered by the same model with SuperGrep's
tools and with Claude Code's file tools, on four Claude models. On Sonnet,
Opus and Fable the answers come out level, inside the judge's own noise; the
saving is the bill and the tail. Where SuperGrep does better on every model is
the whole-corpus question - counts, rankings, every occurrence - because an
index gives the total where grep gives the first forty matches. Where it does
worse is "where is X handled" and "where is this symbol" on the larger models:
a strong model reading whole files finds a named thing well, the agent's
built-in Explore subagent is designed for exactly that, and most of the wrong
claims SuperGrep makes there say which code path calls which function. That
gap is real. It does not mean answers will read worse in production, but it is
worth knowing which questions to expect it on. The figures, by caller and by
kind of question, are in the [README](../README.md#the-numbers).

### It does not do structural code intelligence

No call-graph tracing, dead-code detection, type resolution, or
symbol-precise references. It ranks and retrieves content and aggregates by
relevance. Tools that resolve structure (LSP servers, graph indexes) are
complementary: MCP servers stack, so run both when you need both.

### The first index of a repo pays a one-time vector cost

Keyword search is live in seconds, but the vector stage embeds every chunk
once. It runs on the platform, in the background, and only happens once;
incremental syncs afterward re-embed only changed files.

### Semantic ranking waits for vectors to be created

Until the vector stage finishes, search is keyword-ranked (BM25) and says so.
That is a graceful degrade, not a failure, but meaning-only queries with no
shared vocabulary are weaker until vectors land.

### Retrieval quality depends on the embedding model

The platform embeds with its own model by default. `--embed-provider local`
embeds on this machine with a small local model and ships the vectors
instead; that model optimizes quality-per-minute on commodity hardware, and
the choice is documented in [the embedder eval](embedder-eval.md).

### The platform copy puts the network in the build

With `--db` every build and every sync also writes the platform table, over
HTTPS, and a database that is not yet ready is retried for a bounded time
(`--cold-start-secs`) before the client gives up. `find`, `search` and `sql`
never wait on it - they read the local index - but a sync is not done until
both sides have the diff, and a platform failure is reported and retried by
the next sync rather than papered over. What you get in exchange is the
`ask` tool, which runs on the platform and returns the facts it retrieved
instead of the coding agent crawling the repo itself.


### Very large or hostile repos

Indexing scales roughly linearly with the tree. Pathological files (parser
stress fixtures, generated blobs) fall back to fixed-window chunking under a
per-parse deadline so a single file cannot stall a run. Practical caps
(`CX_MAX_FILES`, `CX_MAX_FILE_BYTES`) bound the work.

When a tree exceeds the file cap the index is partial, and it says so rather
than pretending to be complete: `cx index` warns on the build and on every
sync while the tree is over the cap, `find`, `search` and `sql` results carry a
`partial` marker (files skipped and the cap in effect), and `cx status`
reports it. That turns "no match" into "no match in the indexed subset" - raise
`CX_MAX_FILES` and re-index for full coverage. Or leave the corpus where it is:
write it out as parquet and have the platform build the index next to it in
object storage, with nothing indexed on your machine and no cap to raise
([instructions](../README.md#indexing-from-object-storage)).
