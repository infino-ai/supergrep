// The three retrieval doors, shared by the CLI and the MCP server:
//
//   find   - the grep door: every line containing an exact string, cited
//            path:line. Complete and unranked - "every place this appears"
//            is a different question from "the chunks most about it".
//   search - the finding door: one ranked pass fuses exact keyword matching
//            (BM25) with semantic similarity (vectors, RRF) once vectors are
//            ready; ranked keyword search until then. Hits carry chunk
//            content, so answers come straight from results.
//   sql    - the power door: read-only SQL over the index, built on the search
//            table functions (bm25_search / hybrid_search) composed with
//            GROUP BY, with {{name}} placeholders embedded server-side for the
//            vector functions.
//
// `find` runs against the LOCAL index (the in-process engine on the handle),
// and so do `search` and `sql` unless the MCP server is told otherwise. The
// platform table the `ask` tool reads is the same index in
// another place, and the doors reach for it in two cases: under
// CX_REMOTE_SEARCH the hosted table is the index, so `search` goes through
// `searchHosted` and every `sql` statement through `runSqlRows`; and a `sql`
// statement that embeds a query (`embedsAQuery`) goes through `runSqlRows`
// whenever a database is configured at all, because the platform embeds it
// with the table's own model and the local side is lexical. The row doors at
// the end of this file serve a hosted table of another shape. What a platform
// call cost goes to the usage ledger (hostedTelemetry), not into a result.
