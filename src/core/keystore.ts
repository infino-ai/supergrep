// The account on this machine: a bearer key in a file only its owner can read,
// and beside it the plain facts needed to use it - which platform it belongs to
// and where its console is.
//
// It lives in the user's own `~/.infino/`, not in a repository's `.infino/`,
// because an account is per-person and a repository is not. One account holds
// every repository's database, so a copy in each repo would be the same secret
// written once per checkout - into directories that get committed, zipped,
// copied to a colleague, or synced to a backup. Once, in the home directory,
// with every repo's MCP entry naming that one path, is the same key with one
// place to protect and one place to revoke.
//
// The key is written at 0600 and the directory at 0700, on every write, not
// only on create: a file that already existed with looser permissions is
// tightened rather than trusted. Reading one that is still readable by anyone
// else warns - it is the user's file and refusing to work would be worse than
// telling them - but nothing here ever prints the key itself.
