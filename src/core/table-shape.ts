// The shape of the hosted table the three doors read when `search` reads the
// hosted index (CX_REMOTE_SEARCH): which columns it has, which of them carry
// a text index, which one the platform embeds, and which one names a row.
//
// The doors were written for one table - the chunks table this client
// builds, whose columns are constants (path, start_line, end_line, content,
// embedding). Pointed at a table something else loaded (CX_TABLE naming a
// hydrated corpus), those constants are wrong: a hybrid search asking for
// `embedding` on a table whose vector column is `emb` is a 400, and a find
// over `content` has no such column to match in. So the shape comes from the
// table itself: its schema (POST /v1/schema, the platform's JSON column
// descriptors) and, once the optimizer has written one, its card, whose
// per-column index role says which columns are searchable rather than
// leaving that to be inferred from the types. A chunks-shaped table keeps
// every constant and every code path the doors had, byte for byte; what is
// here is for the other kind.
