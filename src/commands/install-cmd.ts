// `cx install` - write this server's MCP entry into a client's config, for
// users who reach code-context as a plain MCP server rather than through the
// Claude Code plugin. It writes the entry the plugin would otherwise supply:
// the command, the `mcp` subcommand, and whichever platform flags were asked
// for. Nothing else about the client is touched.
//
// The default target is `.mcp.json` in the repo root - project-scoped, so a
// colleague who opens the repo gets the server without setup, and shareable
// because it names a key *file* rather than a key. `--config` targets any
// client config using the same `mcpServers` shape (Cursor, Windsurf, a
// user-scoped Claude Code file).
//
// The API key is never written here. `--api-key-file` records the path the
// server reads at startup; the key itself stays in that file, out of argv and
// out of a config that may be committed. Passing a key value to this command
// is refused rather than quietly written.
//
// With no flags at all, this command uses the account `cx login` stored on
// this machine: it registers the repository's own database if it is not there
// yet, and writes an entry naming that database and nothing else. No key, and
// no path under anybody's home directory - the server finds the key itself, so
// the same `.mcp.json` works for every colleague who has signed in, and a
// second repository is again one command with no arguments.
//
// Three rules hold throughout, carried over from the enforcement installer
// this replaces: ownership is decided per server *name*, so other servers are
// never rewritten or removed; the replace is a temp file plus rename beside
// the real file the path resolves to, so a crash cannot truncate a config and
// a dotfile symlink survives it; and a config we cannot parse is refused
// rather than overwritten.

 * No flags, an account stored: this repository's own database on that account,
 *   registered here if it is not there yet. The entry names the database and
 *   nothing else - not the key, not a path to it - because the server resolves
 *   the key from the same stored account at startup. That is what makes the
 *   config shareable and the second repository flag-free.
 * No flags, no account: the three local tools, and the one line that says how
 *   to get the other two.
 *
 * A create that fails does not always cancel the platform half. A network
 * blip or a 5xx is transient and the entry is still the right one to write; a
 * refused key or an unpayable account is not, and writing a database entry
 * that can never answer would hand the user a config that fails every session
