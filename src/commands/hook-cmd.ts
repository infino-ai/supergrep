// The Claude Code hooks `cx install` writes for the `answer` tool, both run
// by Claude Code with the event as JSON on stdin.
//
// `cx hook answer` - PostToolUse. Runs after the tool returns; finds the
// answer file the result names and prints the chunk it is responsible for
// as a `systemMessage`, which Claude Code shows to the person and never to
// the model. One hook entry per chunk (`--chunk i --chunks n`), so an answer
// longer than one message's cap is shown whole across them (see
// core/answer-display.ts).
//
// `cx hook answer-due` - PostToolUse, on the RETRIEVAL tools rather than on
// `answer`. Runs the moment rows come back and puts one sentence in front of
// the model through `additionalContext`: the writer has these rows, do not
// write the answer yourself, call `answer` when ready. It exists because the
// two halves of that rule were enforced unequally - a Stop hook sends a model
// back for the call it skipped, while not-writing was only a sentence in the
// tool text, read once at the top of the turn. Measured 2026-09-22: Haiku
// wrote its own answer first in 9 runs of 11 and called the tool afterwards
// anyway; Opus 0 of 25, Sonnet 0 of 23.
//
// `cx hook answer-input` - PreToolUse. Runs before the tool; reads the
// session transcript Claude Code names in the event and fills the call's
// `narration` with what the model said since the person's question - its
// text between tool calls - through the hook's `updatedInput`. The writer
// then reads the model's own account of the evidence beside the rows, and
// the model typed none of it for the purpose: measured 2026-09-21, a model
// asked to write notes for the writer spent 26 s of a 45 s run on them,
// while its narration was already in the transcript.
//
// The model's thinking blocks are not read. They are the model's own, and
// a product that lifts them out of the transcript for another model is what
// Opus 5's safeguards call reasoning extraction (a description that merely
// mentioned "what you thought" refused a whole session on 2026-09-21). What
// the model says is what it chose to put on the record.
//
// Neither ever fails the tool call: no marker, no file, no transcript, or a
// chunk past the end of the answer prints nothing and exits 0.
