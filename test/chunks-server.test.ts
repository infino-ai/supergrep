// The chunks table under CX_REMOTE_SEARCH, end to end through the MCP server
// on an in-memory transport against a scripted platform: the path the live
// demo runs. The default table is never probed for its shape - it is the
// table this client builds, so its mode is chunks without asking - and
// startup reads the one card the sql description folds in, with no
// cold-start retries, so the MCP handshake is never held behind a platform
// that is cold or answering 503 at spawn (the third server below). After
// that find and plain sql are local tools that make NO platform request -
// not before their answer, not for it - while search reads the hosted index
// through the readiness memo by hybrid_search with the chunks table's own
// columns, and a sql statement that embeds a query goes to query_sql with
// its placeholder folded into the platform's own, its rows numbered as the
// local path numbers chunks - switch or no switch (the fourth server). Since
// 2026-09-12 - before that such a statement ran on the local index, which on
// a corpus whose local index was built keyword-only failed every
// hybrid_search the model wrote (OpenSearch, the side-by-side demo). The
// tool text is the chunks text. Auto-index is off here so a local door with
// no index answers "no index yet" rather than building one against the
// scripted platform; the point is where each door goes, not what it finds.
